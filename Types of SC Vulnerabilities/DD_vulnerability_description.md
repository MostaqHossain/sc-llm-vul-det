# **Dangerous Delegatecall Vulnerability for Smart Contracts**

## **Overview**
A **delegatecall** vulnerability occurs when a smart contract uses `delegatecall` without proper restrictions. Since `delegatecall` runs the callee's code in the caller’s execution context, it can lead to security risks such as **Ether loss, storage corruption, or unexpected contract behavior**.

---

## **Vulnerability Detection Criteria**
A function is considered vulnerable if it meets the following conditions:

1. **DelegateInvocation**: The function uses `delegatecall`.
2. **OwnerInvocation**: The function is **not** restricted to being called only by the contract owner.

A function is labeled **vulnerable (`label = 1`)** if:
```
DelegateInvocation ∧ !OwnerInvocation
```

---

## **Examples of Vulnerable Cases**

### **1. Unprotected Delegatecall**
The function `forward` allows any user to call `delegatecall` with arbitrary data, which can lead to unauthorized execution and storage manipulation.

```solidity
contract Proxy { 
    function forward(address callee, bytes memory _data) public {
        require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
    }
}
```

- **Issue**: No `onlyOwner` restriction, allowing external users to exploit `delegatecall`.
- **Risk**: Attackers can manipulate contract storage or execute unintended code.
- **Label**: 1 (Vulnerable)

---

## **Examples of Safe Cases (Not Vulnerable)**

### **1. Restricting Delegatecall to Owner**
The function `forward` ensures that only the contract owner can execute `delegatecall`, preventing unauthorized execution.

```solidity
contract Proxy {
    address owner;
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }
    
    function forward(address callee, bytes memory _data) public onlyOwner {
        require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
    }
}
```

- **Fix**: Uses `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict `delegatecall` execution.
- **Label**: 0 (Safe)

---

## **Conclusion**
A function has a **Dangerous Delegatecall Vulnerability** if:
- It allows **any user** to execute `delegatecall` without restriction.  
- It lacks an **owner verification mechanism (`onlyOwner`)**.  

A function is **Safe** if:
- It restricts `delegatecall` execution to the **contract owner (`onlyOwner`)**.
