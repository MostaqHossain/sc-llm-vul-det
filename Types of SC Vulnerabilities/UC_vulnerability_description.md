# **Unchecked Call Vulnerability in Smart Contracts**

## **Overview**
An **Unchecked Call** vulnerability occurs when a contract makes an external call (e.g., `call`, `delegatecall`, `send`, `transfer`) **without verifying if the call was successful**. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as **loss of funds, contract failure, or reentrancy attacks**.

---

## **Vulnerability Detection Criteria**
A function is considered vulnerable if it meets the following conditions:

1. **External Call (`call`, `delegatecall`, `send`, `transfer`)**: The function makes a low-level call to another contract.
2. **Unchecked Return Value**: The function **does not check** whether the call succeeded.

A function is labeled **vulnerable (`label = 1`)** if:
```
External Call âˆ§ !Return Check
```

---

## **Examples of Vulnerable Cases**

### **1. Unchecked External Call**
The function **`withdrawFunds`** transfers Ether using `.call{value}` but **does not check if the call succeeded**.

```solidity
contract UncheckedCall {
    function withdrawFunds(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        recipient.call{value: amount}("");  // Unchecked external call
    }
}
```
- **Issue**: If `call{value: amount}("")` fails, the function **still proceeds** as if the transfer succeeded.
- **Risk**: Funds can be **lost** or **locked** in the contract.
- **Label: 1 (Vulnerable)**

---

## **Examples of Safe Cases (Not Vulnerable)**

### **1. Checking Return Value of `call`**
The function **`withdrawFunds`** properly checks if `call` was successful before proceeding.

```solidity
contract CheckedCall {
    function withdrawFunds(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");  // Ensures transfer succeeded
    }
}
```
- **Fix**: Uses `require(success, "Transfer failed")` to revert the transaction if the call fails.
- **Label: 0 (Safe)**

---

### **2. Using `transfer` Instead of `call`**
Using `.transfer()` ensures that the transaction **automatically reverts** if it fails.

```solidity
contract SafeTransfer {
    function withdrawFunds(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        recipient.transfer(amount);  // Safer alternative (auto-reverts on failure)
    }
}
```
- **Fix**: `.transfer()` automatically **reverts** on failure.
- **Label: 0 (Safe)**

---

## **Summary**
A function has an **Unchecked Call Vulnerability** if:
- It makes an **external call (`call`, `delegatecall`, `send`)**.  
- It does **not check** if the call was successful.  

A function is **Safe** if:
- It **verifies the return value** of the external call.  
- It **uses safer alternatives** like `.transfer()` or `.send()` (but `.send()` should still be checked).
